### Communication plan: 
How will your group communicate with each other? 
We will communicate verbally in person and in writing over slack.
Use @ so that person gets a notification. Keep Slack questions late in the evening simple.
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? 
Whenever someone is talking, the whole group will listen.
When a new idea is presented, everyone give constructive ideas related to it and recognizes the person’s idea.
Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?
Check in on how everyone is doing regularly. Don’t be judgemental.
Speak up when bothered by something. Go to someone else for support if needed. 

  
### Conflict plan: 
What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
In the case of a disagreement, we will list out the pros and cons of each approach and make a decision as a group.
Compromise. Hear each party out. Weigh passion and logical conviction into the equation. Identify the feeling and talk about the feeling if emotions get intense.
If no resolution, we will rock-paper-scissors (best 2 out of 3)
  

### Work plan: 
How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 
We will use a Trello Board to keep track of tasks and who is working on what
At the beginning of each day, we will go over what needs to be done and assign tasks.
If you’re done with a task, help out another teammate who may be struggling.
Code reviews will be done by 1 other person.
If there is a conflict, the team should collectively decide what is best.
If there is an agreement, a merge can happen.
How will you make sure that everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems?
Pair programming is an option.
If a person thinks they can handle the task, they should speak up and break off to work on it solo.
Enforce 15 min rule
If a task is too difficult and the person is struggling for more than 15 mins, then they should pair up or ask for help.
  

### Git process: 
What is your Git flow? 
Every will have their branch, push their branch to their remote branch, merge into dev and then to master if everyone agrees
Only clean working code on master branch.  Make sure to comment your code.  The reviewer will check these comments.
Naming convention for branches: day-yourName-feature.
Commit messages have day-feature/whatYouFixed
How many people must review a PR? 
One person will review a pull before merging to the development branch, and everyone must review a pull request to master.
If another pair of eyes is needed, a different person will take a look.
Who merges PRs?
The person or team who reviewed the pull request should be the one to merge the pull request.
  

### Anything else you feel is important: 
Expectations around work times, 
Show up at 9am, work until 6pm or later.
standup times
We will check in with each other at the beginning of each work day
Before stand-up with the Instructional staff, we’ll have our own stand up
taking breaks
If you need it, take it. If someone feels that someone else is taking too many breaks, they should discuss it with the group.
